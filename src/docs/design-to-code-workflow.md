# Design-to-Code Workflow

This document outlines the process for translating designs into code, ensuring consistency between design assets and the implemented UI.

## Overview

The design-to-code workflow is a collaborative process between designers and developers to ensure that the implemented UI accurately reflects the design intent while maintaining code quality and performance.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Design in Figma

1. **Create components in Figma** following our design system guidelines
   - Use the defined color palette, typography, and spacing
   - Organize components into a consistent structure
   - Document component variants and states

2. **Design review**
   - Review designs for consistency with the design system
   - Ensure accessibility requirements are met
   - Get feedback from stakeholders

3. **Prepare for handoff**
   - Organize layers and groups with clear naming
   - Document any complex interactions or animations
   - Create component variants for different states

### 2. Design Handoff

1. **Share Figma designs** with developers
   - Provide access to the Figma file
   - Document any specific implementation details

2. **Walkthrough session**
   - Designer walks through the designs with developers
   - Discuss any complex interactions or animations
   - Clarify any questions about the implementation

3. **Extract design tokens**
   - Identify colors, spacing, typography, and other design tokens
   - Ensure these match our existing design system
   - Document any new tokens that need to be added

### 3. Implementation

1. **Component planning**
   - Identify which existing components can be used or extended
   - Plan new components that need to be created
   - Determine the component hierarchy and structure

2. **Build components**
   - Implement components using our shadcn/ui foundation
   - Follow the component structure defined in our design system
   - Use the design tokens from our theme

3. **Review implementation**
   - Compare the implemented UI with the design
   - Check for visual accuracy and behavior
   - Ensure responsive behavior matches the design intent

### 4. Testing and Refinement

1. **Visual testing**
   - Compare the implemented UI with the design visually
   - Check for pixel-perfect alignment and spacing
   - Verify colors, typography, and other visual elements

2. **Functional testing**
   - Test component behavior and interactions
   - Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes
   - Check accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation

3. **Refinement**
   - Make adjustments based on testing feedback
   - Optimize performance if needed
   - Document any deviations from the design and the reasons

### 5. Documentation

1. **Update component documentation**
   - Document the new components and their usage
   - Provide examples of different variants and states
   - Include any specific implementation details

2. **Update design system documentation**
   - Add any new design tokens or patterns
   - Document any changes to existing components
   - Ensure the documentation reflects the current state of the design system

## Tools and Resources

### Design Tools

- **Figma**: Primary design tool for creating and sharing designs
- **Figma Tokens**: Plugin for managing design tokens in Figma

### Development Tools

- **shadcn/ui**: Component library foundation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Storybook**: Tool for developing and documenting components in isolation

### Collaboration Tools

- **GitHub**: Version control and code review
- **Linear**: Issue tracking and project management
- **Slack**: Team communication

## Best Practices

### For Designers

1. **Follow the design system**: Use the established design tokens, components, and patterns
2. **Design with implementation in mind**: Consider how the design will be implemented in code
3. **Document complex interactions**: Provide clear documentation for any complex interactions or animations
4. **Consider edge cases**: Design for different states, content lengths, and screen sizes
5. **Maintain a component library**: Keep the Figma component library up to date with the implemented components

### For Developers

1. **Use existing components**: Leverage the existing component library whenever possible
2. **Follow the design system**: Use the established design tokens and patterns
3. **Communicate challenges**: If a design is difficult to implement, communicate early with the design team
4. **Document deviations**: If implementation differs from the design, document the reasons
5. **Update component documentation**: Keep the component documentation up to date

## Communication Channels

- **Design reviews**: Regular meetings to review designs before implementation
- **Implementation reviews**: Reviews of the implemented UI to ensure it matches the design
- **Slack channels**: Dedicated channels for design system discussions
- **Documentation**: Shared documentation for the design system and components

## Continuous Improvement

The design-to-code workflow is an iterative process that should be continuously improved. Regular retrospectives should be held to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.

### Feedback Loops

1. **Designer feedback on implementation**: Designers review the implemented UI and provide feedback
2. **Developer feedback on designs**: Developers provide feedback on the feasibility of designs
3. **User feedback**: Incorporate user feedback into the design and implementation process
4. **Performance metrics**: Monitor performance metrics and make improvements as needed

## Conclusion

A well-defined design-to-code workflow ensures consistency between design and implementation, improves collaboration between designers and developers, and results in a better user experience. By following this process, we can maintain a high-quality design system that evolves with the needs of our users and product.
