# Next Legend Kickstarter Component Library

Welcome to the Next Legend Kickstarter component library. This Storybook contains all the components, patterns, and guidelines for building applications with our design system.

## Component Organization

Our components are organized into the following categories:

- **UI Components**: Basic UI elements like buttons, inputs, cards, etc.
- **Layout Components**: Components for page layout like containers, grids, etc.
- **Form Components**: Components for building forms like inputs, selects, etc.
- **Features**: Higher-level components that implement specific features.
- **Pages**: Complete page templates and examples.

## Getting Started

To use these components in your application:

1. Import the component from its respective location:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
```

2. Use the component in your JSX:

```jsx
<Button variant="default">Click Me</Button>
```

## Design Principles

Our design system follows these core principles:

1. **Consistency**: Components should look and behave consistently across the application.
2. **Accessibility**: All components should be accessible to all users.
3. **Flexibility**: Components should be flexible enough to adapt to different use cases.
4. **Performance**: Components should be optimized for performance.

## Contributing

To contribute to this component library:

1. Create a new component in the appropriate directory.
2. Create a story file for the component.
3. Document the component using MDX.
4. Submit a pull request for review.
