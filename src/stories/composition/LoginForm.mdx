## Loading State

The login form can display a loading state to indicate that the form is being processed:

<Story of={LoginFormStories.Loading} />

## With Pre-filled Email

This example demonstrates how to pre-fill the email field:

<Story of={LoginFormStories.WithPrefilledEmail} />

## Component Breakdown

The LoginForm component is composed of the following UI components:

- **Card**: Provides the container and styling for the form
- **Label**: Provides accessible labels for form inputs
- **Input**: Captures user input for email and password
- **Checkbox**: Allows users to toggle the "Remember me" option
- **Button**: Submits the form and shows loading state

## Accessibility Considerations

The LoginForm component is designed with accessibility in mind:

- All form fields have proper labels
- The form can be navigated using keyboard
- Loading states are properly communicated
- Error states (not shown in this example) should be properly announced to screen readers
