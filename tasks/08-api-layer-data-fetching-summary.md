# API Layer and Data Fetching - Implementation Summary

## 8.1. API Design

### 8.1.1. Design RESTful API Structure
- Created a structured API directory at `src/app/api/v1/`
- Implemented root API endpoint with version information
- Created user-related endpoints (`/users`, `/users/[id]`, `/users/me`)
- Designed consistent URL patterns and HTTP methods

### 8.1.2. Create API Documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Implemented OpenAPI documentation at `/api/v1/docs`
- Documented API endpoints, methods, and response formats
- Included metadata about the API (version, title, description)

### 8.1.3. Define Request and Response Models
- Created Zod schemas for validation in `src/app/api/v1/types`
- Defined models for users, projects, tasks, and API responses
- Implemented type-safe request and response handling

### 8.1.4. Implement Error Handling Standards
- Created utility functions for standardized API responses
- Implemented error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Added validation for request bodies and parameters

## 8.2. Server Components and API Routes

### 8.2.1. Set up Next.js API Routes Structure
- Organized API routes following Next.js App Router conventions
- Implemented route handlers for different HTTP methods
- Created nested routes for resource-specific operations

### 8.2.2. Implement Server Components for Data Fetching
- Created server components for fetching user data
- Implemented components for displaying user lists and details
- Used React Server Components for efficient data fetching

### 8.2.3. Configure Middleware for API Routes
- Implemented middleware for API request processing
- Created a middleware chain for sequential processing
- Added middleware for authentication, CORS, and other concerns

### 8.2.4. Implement Rate Limiting and Security Measures
- Added rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse
- Implemented authentication middleware for protected routes
- Added CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests

## 8.3. Data Fetching Strategies

### 8.3.1. Set up React Query or SWR for Client-side Data Fetching
- Implemented custom hooks using SWR for data fetching
- Configured fetcher functions for API requests
- Set up error handling and loading states

### 8.3.2. Create Custom Hooks for Data Fetching
- Created hooks for common operations (useUsers, useUser, useCurrentUser)
- Implemented mutation hooks (useCreateUser, useUpdateUser, useDeleteUser)
- Designed a consistent API for data fetching hooks

### 8.3.3. Implement Optimistic Updates
- Created OptimisticTodo component for immediate UI updates
- Implemented optimistic updates for adding, toggling, and deleting todos
- Added fallback handling for failed operations

### 8.3.4. Configure Caching Strategies
- Set up SWR with appropriate caching configurations
- Implemented cache invalidation for related resources
- Configured revalidation strategies for data freshness

## Build Status
- Successfully built the application with `npm run build`
- Resolved ESLint configuration to handle warnings appropriately
- All API routes and components are properly compiled and ready for deployment
